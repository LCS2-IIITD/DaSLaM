### Input: Three birds are flying at a fast rate of 900 kilometers per hour. What is their speed in miles per minute? [1km = 0.6 miles] A)32400 B)6000 C)600 D)60000 E)10
### Response: Let us think step by step, 
To calculate the equivalent of miles in a kilometer
0.6 kilometers = 1 mile
900 kilometers = (0.6)*900 = 540 miles
In 1 hour there are 60 minutes
Speed in miles/minutes = 60 * 540 = 32400

### Input: A ship is leaving a port. It takes 240 seconds to passes through a 750m channel to get to the port gates, and takes 60 seconds to pass through the gates of the port. What is its length? A)100 m B)150 m C)200 m D)250 m E)300 m
### Response: Let the length of the ship be x metres and its speed be y m/sec. 
Then, x / y = 60 
 y = x / 60
 (x + 750) / 240 = x / 60 
  x = 250 m.

### Input: A rectangular piece of cloth 2 feet wide was cut lengthwise into two smaller rectangular pieces. The shorter piece was one-third of the length of the longer of the 2 new pieces and had an area of 12 square feet. What was the length Q in feet of the original piece of cloth before cutting? A)6 B)18 C)24 D)36 E)48
### Response: The question says, length of shorter piece is 1/3rd of the length of longer of the two new pieces
This means after I split it into two pieces, I have a shorter piece and a longer one. The length of shorter is 1/3rd the length of longer. The 6 I found out was length of shorter piece. Then, length of longer should be 18 and total length should be 24.

### Input: In the xy-coordinate plane, which of the following points must lie on the line kx + 2y = 6 for every possible value of k? A)(1,1) B)(0,3) C)(2,0) D)(3,6) E)(6,3)
### Response: Let us think step by step,
For a point to satisfy the given equation for all possible values of k, then x must equal 0.
When x=0, the equation is simply 2y = 6, and then y = 3.
