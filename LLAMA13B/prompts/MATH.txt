Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input and a reasoning that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction: solve the following question, the final answer is a number. Report the final answer inside brackets as [[Answer: 33]]

### Input: What is the value of 9^3 + 3(9^2) + 3(9) + 1?
### Response: Let us think step by step, 
The given expression is the expansion of (9+1)^3.  
In general, the cube of (x+y)^3 is (x+y)^3=1x^3+3x^2y+3xy^2+1y^3.  
The first and last terms in the given expression are cubes and the middle two terms both have coefficient 3, giving us a clue that this is a cube of a binomial and can be written in the form (x+y)^3
In this case, x=9 and y=1, so our answer is (9+1)^3 
[[Answer: 1000]]

### Input: Let N denote the number of 7 digit positive integers have the property that their digits are in increasing order. Determine the remainder obtained when N is divided by 1000. (Repeated digits are allowed.)

### Response: Let us think step by step,
Note that a 7 digit increasing integer is determined once we select a set of 7 digits. 
To determine the number of sets of 7 digits, consider 9 urns labeled 1,2,\\cdots,9 (note that 0 is not a permissible digit); then we wish to drop 7 balls into these urns. 
Using the ball-and-urn argument, having 9 urns is equivalent to 8 dividers, and there are {8 + 7 \\choose 7} = {15 \\choose 7} = 6435 
[[Answer: 435]] 


### Input: How many different positive integers can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14, 15, 16 \\}?
### Response: Let us think step by step, 
We can see that the maximum positive difference is 16 - 1 = 15. 
Some quick calculations show that we can get all values between 1 and 15. 
\\begin{align*}\n16 - 1 &= 15 \\\\\n16 - 2 &= 14 \\\\\n16 - 3 &= 13 \\\\\n& \\ \\,\\vdots \\\\\n16-14&=2\\\\\n16-15&=1\n\\end{align*} 
Therefore there are 15 different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14, 15, 16 \\}.
[[Answer: 15]]

### Input: Alice and Bob play a game with a baseball. On each turn, if Alice has the ball, there is a 1/2 chance that she will toss it to Bob and a 1/2 chance that she will keep the ball. If Bob has the ball, there is a 2/5 chance that he will toss it to Alice, and if he doesn't toss it to Alice, he keeps it. Alice starts with the ball. What is the probability that Alice has the ball again after two turns?
### Response: Let us think step by step,
We can solve this problem by dividing it into cases. 
If Alice tosses the baseball to Bob on the first turn, there is a 2/5 chance that Bob will toss it back to her on the next turn.
On the other hand, if Alice keeps the baseball on the first turn, there is a 1/2 chance that she will also keep it on the second turn. 
The total probability is then \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{9}{20}
[[Answer: 0.45]]
